Random samples of code I've written. By no means a complete showcase of my knowledge, just a couple snippets!

* default_values.sql - Code in a trigger used to set default row values based on complex business rules.  New rows written via an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) application.

* trigger_update.sql - Code in trigger for same db to update row values bsaed on business rules.  Updates coming from an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) application.
