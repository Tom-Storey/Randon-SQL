Random samples of code I've written. By no means a complete showcase of my knowledge, just a couple snippets!

* Function Design.docx - Detailed design and code related to a complex function supporting the metrics star-schema data warehouse.

* sp_ssrs_report_dataset.sql - Code in a stored procedure that served as the dataset for an SSRS report.   Some examples of joins and temporary tables.   I inherited this db that had some bad design, but was still able to make several reports by doing some advanced querying.

* trigger_insert.sql - Code in a trigger used to set default row values based on complex business rules.  New rows written via an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) application.

* trigger_update.sql - Code in trigger for same db to update row values bsaed on business rules.  Updates coming from an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) application.
